When I was working in a company as an intern, I build this application which is basically a storytelling application where you story coming from the server and you can choose your choice in order turn story in your direction.

The application uses firebase to store stories and also it shows different twists according to user choice. It has a quite simple user interface with some animation, the application will upload new stories as they completing writing the stories by writer and the user does not need to update the application in order to read new content. I have used a custom user interface because requirements are to make the app more like a book so we have made the custom drawable and view to perform this action.

### Technolgies : Android SDK , Java, Xml, Firebase

# Covid Tracker

I build this application when I was doing a challenge at topcoder where i have APIs for the covid-19 data so this application used to track cases all over the world.
The application uses retrofit, data binding, and Rx java for calling API and fetch all the data in order to show on the list. I used graphs also for indicating the number of cases, deaths, and confirmed cases all over the world. You can also see data particular to a country.

### Technolgies : Kotlin,Room,Dagger 2.0 ,RxJava / RxAndroid,RxRelay,Timber,Jetpack LibrariesRetrofit


## Some Cool Projects :smile:

Application is used to control keyboard and mouse in the computer using an android phone, you need to install server application in computer and apk in android, in order to work the application your both devices should be in the same network. You can even play games using a gyro sensor in android.

### Computer vision controller

You can use a single paper to control the game, you just need to show paper in front of camera and move to different directions in order to control the game.
This application is using the OpenCV for performing computer vision algorithms it is used to capture the color and also calculate a distance where the paper is moved and then converting coordinate into a game coordinate and press the buttons for controlling the game.
